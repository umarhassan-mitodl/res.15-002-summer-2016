The purpose is to gain insights into their operations to enable government partnering agencies to better interface and protect taxpayer dollars in various public-private partnerships that can form to extend credit to borrowers.

*   Metrics for detecting the games

Predicting Credit Risk at For-Profit Lending Partners
