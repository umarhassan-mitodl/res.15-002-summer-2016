The GCFP serves as a catalyst for innovative, cross-disciplinary and non-partisan research and educational initiatives addressing the unique challenges facing governments in their role as financial institutions and as regulators of the financial system. {{% resource_link "1a046c10-8543-41fc-804f-6513c0bee121" "Learn more at the GCFP website" %}}.

Overview
--------

A large and growing loan portfolio—which has tripled in size since 2008—highlights the need for policymakers and credit program managers to have a deeper understanding of the financial principles at play in running what has become the world’s largest financial institution. As the U.S. government seeks to accomplish a diverse set of public policy objectives, it is challenged to keep pace with an increasingly sophisticated and interconnected financial marketplace. This training course from the MIT Golub Center for Finance and Policy is aimed at executive and legislative branch decision-makers and staff to enhance their understanding of the core finance principles necessary to design and operate government credit programs efficiently.
